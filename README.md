A command line/ascii graphics dinosaur hunting game

A dumb little game written in Python to help me learn how this stupid language works.
Works okay at the minute but definitely feels over-engineered. But that's what this is for.

When I say it works okay... I basically mean it starts and ends without any obvious errors.
It's not fun.
It's not fun at all.
But it works. And it's testing my programming knowledge.

It's also helping me refresh my memory using git and GitHub.

HOW TO PLAY:

Picking a game mode decides how many dinosaurs there are to hunt.

The player moves twice, dinosaurs move once.

Land on a dinosaur's space to catch it.

If they land on your space, it's game over.

Type 'up', 'down', 'left', and 'right' to move.
