A command line/ascii graphics dinosaur hunting game

A dumb little game written in Python to help me learn how this stupid language works.
Works okay at the minute but definitely feels over-engineered. But that's what this is for.

When I say it works okay... I basically mean it starts and ends without any obvious errors.
It's not fun.
It's not fun at all.
But it works. And it's testing my programming knowledge.

It's also helping me refresh my memory using git and GitHub.

HOW TO PLAY:

Pick a player to choose how many moves you get.

Pick a difficulty to choose how many dinosaurs are in the world.

Land on a dinosaur's space to catch it.

If they land on your space, it's game over.

Type 'up', 'down', 'left', and 'right' to move.

CURRENTLY WORKING ON THE FIGHT MECHANIC

Player and Dinosaur will have a turn based fight when they are in the same space.
